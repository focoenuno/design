The problems we want to solve and their possible solutions.

## I can't watch a video without getting distracted

* As an user I can paste a video url and everything else is blocked until the 
video is finished.

## I can't read anything without getting distracted

* As an user I can read a file from my machine and everything else is blocked 
until it is finished.

## I keep reaching for my phone when studying

* As an user I get to listen to an annoying sound when I look like I'm not 
focusing on the screen.

* As an user someone else receives a notification when I slack off.
